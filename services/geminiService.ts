        - All financial figures MUST be in millions of the local currency (${isIndian ? "INR" : "USD"}).
        - 'ratios' should be for the most recent full year or TTM. Provide insightful commentary and a relevant industry benchmark.
        - 'ratioHistory' should cover the last 5 years for the specified key ratios.
        - 'news' should contain 3-5 recent and highly relevant news articles with a concise summary.
        - 'valuationAssumptions' should be reasonable, industry-standard assumptions for a DCF valuation based on the company's profile and market conditions. These will be used for a later valuation step.
